# Reproducing "Teaching LLMs to Abstain across Languages via Multilingual Feedback"

This repository contains our implementation for reproducing the experiments from the paper:
["Teaching LLMs to Abstain across Languages via Multilingual Feedback"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15948).

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores multilingual feedback as a strategy for improving the abstention behavior of large language models (LLMs), especially in low-resource languages. We implement the **MULTI-RELATED** feedback approach and compare it with other abstention strategies.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details
- **Language:** Python
- **Key Libraries:**
  - [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) â€“ LLM interaction
  - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) â€“ Model inference and computations
  - [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/) - Accessing GPT-4
- **Datasets Used:**
  - [M-MMLU](https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-mmlu)(Multilingual Massive Multitask Language Understanding): Open-sourced and accessible for multilingual QA evaluation
  - [HellaSwag](https://rowanzellers.com/hellaswag/): Open-sourced dataset for commonsense reasoning in multiple languages.
  - [Belebele](https://huggingface.co/datasets/belebele): Multilingual reading comprehension dataset
## ðŸ“Š Dataset Statistics
Below are the specific languages and datasets we used in our experiments. Other languages available in these datasets were not included in our analysis:
